A joss paper wishing wealth and longevity. Before burning, one would write their name on the left hand side and the specific date that they are praying on the write.
The couplets wish wealth and happiness all year round, wherever and whenever. Auspicious symbols of lucky Chinese coins can be seen at the bottom, along with 2 dragons.
